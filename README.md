## My Liri Node App
    -A fun little node App to get relative information about your favorite
     bands, songs and movies.
    -you will get information on the item of your interest depending on the      command you use whether, "movie-this","concert-this",                 
     "spotify-this-song", or "do-what-it-says" 
    
    -Use the commands "concert-this" followed by a band/artist to get upcoming concerts by the artist. Use "spotify-this-song" followed by the track title to get the information about the artist, ablbum, release date and more. Use "movie-this" followed by the title of the movie to get information about the movie, including release date, actors, langauge, rating, etc. Or "do-what-it-says" by itself will run a preloaded command and item.
   
    -to use the Liri App simple type node liri.js into the command line, note    you must be in the directory in which this program is located.
     i.e. node liri.js concert-this ed sheeran
