## My Liri Node App
    -A fun little node App to get relative information about your favorite
     bands, songs and movies.
    -you will get information on the item of your interest depending on the command you use whether, ##"movie-this","concert-this",         
     "spotify-this-song", or "do-what-it-says" 
    
    -Use the commands "concert-this" followed by a band/artist to get upcoming concerts by the artist. Use "spotify-this-song" followed by      the track title to get the information about the artist, ablbum, release date and more. Use "movie-this" followed by the title of the      movie to get information about the movie, including release date, actors, langauge, rating, etc. Or "do-what-it-says" by itself will        run a preloaded command and item.
   
    -to use the Liri App simple type node liri.js into the command line, followed by your command(see above) and the item of interest.          Note you must be in the directory in which this program is located.
